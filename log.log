DEBUG:llama_index.llm_predictor.base:Claim 1 of patent US8205344B2 is for a safety razor, while claim 1 of patent US9889572B2 is for a personal grooming apparatus. 

In terms of structure, both claims involve a handle and a blade unit. However, the pivotal connection structure in US8205344B2 includes a joint member with separated joint elements, while US9889572B2 includes a pivot member with an at least partially spherical surface. 

The movement facilitated by the pivotal connection structure in US8205344B2 is about a hinge axis that is perpendicular to the cutting edge, whereas the pivot member in US9889572B2 is pivotably held between the spaced-apart ends of two opposed legs of a clevis. 

Furthermore, US8205344B2 includes a thinner wall section in the joint member toward the hinge axis, while US9889572B2 includes a stop extending from and above the pivot member's at least partially spherical surface, which interacts with a relief portion of the clevis to limit rotation of the cartridge. 

Overall, while both claims involve a handle, blade unit, and a pivotal connection, the specific structures and mechanisms differ between US8205344B2 and US9889572B2.

DEBUG:llama_index.llm_predictor.base:Claim 1 of patent US8205344B2 is for a safety razor, while claim 1 of patent US9889572B2 is for a personal grooming apparatus. 

In terms of structure, both claims involve a handle and a blade unit. However, the pivotal connection structure in US8205344B2 includes a joint member with separated joint elements along a perpendicular pivot axis, while US9889572B2 includes a pivot member with an at least partially spherical surface that is held between two opposed legs of a clevis.

Furthermore, the movement allowed by the pivotal connection structure in US8205344B2 is about a hinge axis that is substantially perpendicular to the cutting edge, while the rotation of the cutting blade in US9889572B2 is enabled by the pivot member being pivotably held between the spaced-apart ends of the two opposed legs of the clevis.

Additionally, US8205344B2 includes a thinner wall section in the joint member toward the hinge axis, while US9889572B2 includes a stop extending from and above the pivot member's at least partially spherical surface, which interacts with a relief portion of the clevis to limit rotation of the cartridge.

Overall, while both claims involve a handle and a blade unit, they differ in terms of the specific pivotal connection structure and the mechanisms for enabling movement or rotation.

DEBUG:llama_index.llm_predictor.base:Claim 1 of patent US8205344B2 is for a safety razor, while claim 1 of patent US9889572B2 is for a personal grooming apparatus. 

In terms of structure, both claims involve a handle and a blade unit. However, the pivotal connection structure in US8205344B2 includes a joint member with separated joint elements along a perpendicular pivot axis, while US9889572B2 includes a pivot member with an at least partially spherical surface that is held between two opposed legs of a clevis.

Furthermore, the movement allowed by the pivotal connection structure in US8205344B2 is about a hinge axis that is substantially perpendicular to the cutting edge, while the rotation of the cutting blade in US9889572B2 is enabled by the pivot member being pivotably held between the spaced-apart ends of the two opposed legs of the clevis.

Additionally, US8205344B2 includes a thinner wall section in the joint member toward the hinge axis, while US9889572B2 includes a stop extending from and above the pivot member's at least partially spherical surface, which interacts with a relief portion of the clevis to limit rotation of the cartridge.

Overall, while both claims involve a handle and a blade unit, they differ in terms of the specific pivotal connection structure and the mechanisms for enabling movement or rotation.
