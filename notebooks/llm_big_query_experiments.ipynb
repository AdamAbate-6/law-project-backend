       "\"Claim 1 and claim 15 both describe a safety razor with a blade unit having at least one blade and a handle casing, with a pivotal connection structure disposed between the blade unit and the handle casing. However, there are some differences between the two claims.\\n\\nClaim 1 describes the pivotal connection structure as having a joint member comprising a plurality of separated joint elements which are disposed along the perpendicular pivot axis, and which connect the first member and the second member that facilitates movement of the first member relative to the second member about a hinge axis that is substantially perpendicular to the at least one cutting edge. Claim 1 also describes the separated joint elements as including a triangular prism shaped base member and an elastic plate member extending from the base member.\\n\\nOn the other hand, claim 15 describes the pivotal connection structure as being constructed such that the joint member has a hinge axis disposed between the joint portions of the first and second members, which works as the perpendicular pivot axis. Claim 15 also describes the joint member as including a plurality of separated joint elements which are disposed along the perpendicular pivot axis wherein each of the plurality of separated joint elements includes a bearing having a cylindrical shape fixed to the second member, and a pivot shaft having one end fixed to the first member and the other end inserted into the bearing. \\n\\nIn summary, claim 1 describes the pivotal connection structure in more detail, including the shape and material of the separated joint elements, while claim 15 focuses more on the construction of the joint member and its function in allowing the blade unit to follow the contours of a user's skin during shaving.\""

This structure includes a joint member with separated joint elements that connect the first member (connected to the blade unit) and the second member (connected to the handle casing) and facilitate the movement of the blade unit. The joint member has a thinner wall section toward the hinge axis than toward at least one of the joint portions of the first and second members. Additionally, the separated joint elements include a bearing and a pivot shaft that allow for the pivotal movement of the blade unit. This structure allows the razor to follow the contours of a user\\'s skin during shaving. \\n\\nWhile there are other features and elements described in the patent, such as the use of latch arms to secure the pivotal connection structure to the handle casing, a frame with a cam surface, and a detachable shaving cartridge, these features are not unique to this patent and are found in prior art.'"
