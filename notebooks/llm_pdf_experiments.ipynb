      " Particular embodiments of the invention may include one \n",
      " or more of the following features. In particular embodi \n",
      " ments, the longitudinal ends of the blades are bent and are \n",
      " transverse to the cutting edges. In some embodiments, the \n",
      " unit includes tWo metal plates, and one set of longitudinal \n",
      " ends are connected by ?rst Weld connections to a ?rst metal \n",
      " plate, and the other set of longitudinal ends are connected by \n",
      " second Weld connections to a second metal plate. The plates \n",
      " can have a stainless steel base and an aluminum cladding \n",

      " member is attached, With the longitudinal ends of the \n",
      " elongated support being Welded to each other at the tWo \n",

The electronic control device is electrically coupled to the at least one blade and includes a switch for controlling operation of the device between a normal mode and a low power consumption mode. The device also includes an indicator for producing a signal for indicating to a razor user that the electronic control device is connected to a power source and ready to actuate the electrical device.',\n",
