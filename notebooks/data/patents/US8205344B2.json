The safety razor of  claim 7  wherein the pivotal connection structure includes a pair of latch arms that secure the pivotal connection structure to the handle casing. \n     \n     \n       9. The safety razor of  claim 7  wherein the blade unit includes a frame with a cam surface and the handle unit includes a spring-biased plunger with a rounded distal end that contacts the cam surface at a location spaced from the parallel pivot axis to impart a biasing force to the frame. \n     \n     \n       10. The safety razor of  claim 1  further comprising a shaving cartridge which is detachable from the handle unit, wherein the shaving cartridge includes the blade unit and the pivotal connection structure. \n     \n     \n       11. The safety razor of  claim 1  further comprising a shaving cartridge which is detachable from the handle unit, wherein the shaving cartridge includes the blade unit and the handle unit includes the pivotal connection structure. \n     \n     \n       12. The safety razor of  claim 1  wherein the separated joint elements include a triangular prism shaped base member and an elastic plate member extending from the base member. \n     \n     \n       13. The safety razor of  claim 12  wherein the elastic plate member is a leaf spring formed by a metal material. \n     \n     \n       14. The safety razor according to  claim 1 , wherein each of the plurality of separated joint elements includes a bearing having a cylindrical shape fixed to the second member and a pivot shaft having one end fixed to the first member and the other end inserted into the bearing. \n     \n     \n       15. A safety razor comprising a blade unit having at least one blade having a cutting edge, a handle unit having a handle casing, and a pivotal connection structure disposed between the blade unit and the handle casing, the blade unit being connected to the handle casing through the pivotal connection structure for a pivotal movement relative thereto about a perpendicular pivot axis which is substantially perpendicular to the at least one cutting edge for following the skin contours of a user during shaving, the pivotal connection structure including;\n (a) a first member connected to the blade unit, the first member having a joint portion, \n (b) a second member connected to the handle casing, the second member having a joint portion, and \n (c) a joint member for jointing, in a hinged manner, the joint portion of the first member with the joint portion of the second member, the pivotal connection structure is constructed such that the joint member has a hinge axis disposed between the joint portions of the first and second members, which works as the perpendicular pivot axis, the joint member includes a plurality of separated joint elements which are disposed along the perpendicular pivot axis wherein each of the plurality of separated joint elements includes a bearing having a cylindrical shape fixed to the second member, and a pivot shaft having one end fixed to the first member and the other end inserted into the bearing. \n \n     \n     \n       16. The safety razor according to  claim 15 , wherein the first and second members and the joint member are formed by an injection molding process of a thermo plastic material. \n     \n     \n       17.
