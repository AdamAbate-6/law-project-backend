{"spif": "US9889572B2", "title": "Razor with cutting blade rotatable about multiple axes", "abstract": "A razor includes a handle and detachable blade cartridge. The end of the handle has a pivot sphere upon which the blade cartridge is rotatably mounted, with freedom to pivot around three axes of the handle, and otherwise holds its orientation relative to the handle. The blade cartridge is held to the pivot sphere by a clevis having recesses defined in at least the inner side surfaces of its legs. The recesses, together with the clevis, are sized to admit the pivot sphere between them and to hold the sphere therein once admitted. The clevis and/or the pivot sphere can be formed of a resilient injection molded plastic. The range of motion of the blade cartridge can be limited by forming one or more stops on the pivot sphere to interact with the clevis and thereby interrupt its free rotation.", "claims": "What is claimed is: \n     \n       1. A personal grooming apparatus, comprising:\n a handle having a gripping portion and an attachment portion, the attachment portion including a pivot member having an at least partially spherical surface; and \n a cartridge removably attached to the attachment portion and supporting at least one cutting blade; \n wherein rotation of the at least one cutting blade is enabled by a clevis comprising two opposed legs having spaced-apart ends, the pivot member of the attachment portion pivotably held between the spaced-apart ends of the two opposed legs of the clevis; and \n a stop extending from and above the at least partially spherical surface of the pivot member and configured to limit rotation of the cartridge when the cartridge is mounted on the attachment portion; \n wherein the stop is configured to limit rotation of the cartridge by interacting with a relief portion of at least one of the two opposed legs of the clevis; and wherein the two opposed legs of the clevis have respective holes formed therein, and wherein the spherical pivot member is pivotably held between the holes formed in the two opposed legs of the clevis. \n \n     \n     \n       2. The personal grooming apparatus of  claim 1 , wherein the gripping portion supports an at least partial spheroid including the pivot member. \n     \n     \n       3. The personal grooming apparatus of  claim 1 , wherein the two opposed legs form a portion of the cartridge. \n     \n     \n       4. The personal grooming apparatus of  claim 1 , wherein the gripping portion includes friction enhancing depressions and protuberances. \n     \n     \n       5. The personal grooming apparatus of  claim 1 , wherein a portion of the cartridge limits rotation of the at least one cutting blade. \n     \n     \n       6. A razor handle, comprising:\n an elongate body having a gripping portion; \n a pivot member at one end of the body, the pivot member providing a removable attachment to a cartridge supporting at least one cutting blade; \n wherein the pivot member includes an at least partially spherical surface configured to be held between spaced-apart ends of two opposed legs of a clevis; and \n a stop protruding from the at least partially spherical surface of the pivot member and configured to limit rotation of the pivot member; \n wherein the stop is configured to limit rotation of the pivot member by interacting with a relief portion of at least one of the two opposed legs of the clevis; and wherein the two opposed legs of the clevis have respective holes formed therein, and wherein the spherical pivot member is pivotably held between the holes formed in the two opposed legs of the clevis. \n \n     \n     \n       7. The razor handle apparatus of  claim 6 , wherein the gripping portion supports a spheroid including the pivot member. \n     \n     \n       8. The razor handle of  claim 6 , wherein the two opposed legs extend from the cartridge. \n     \n     \n       9. The razor handle of  claim 6 , wherein the gripping portion includes friction enhancing depressions and protuberances. \n     \n     \n       10. The razor handle of  claim 6 , wherein the gripping portion includes a friction enhancing attachment to the elongate body. \n     \n     \n       11. A razor, comprising:\n a cartridge supporting at least one cutting blade; \n a handle having an elongate gripping portion and an attachment portion at one end of the handle, the attachment portion supporting a pivot member providing a removable attachment to the cartridge; \n wherein the pivot member includes an at least partially spherical surface and is configured to be held between spaced-apart ends of two opposed legs of a clevis; and \n a stop protruding from the at least partially spherical surface of the pivot member and configured to limit rotation of the cartridge when the cartridge is mounted on the attachment portion; \n wherein the stop is configured to limit rotation of the cartridge by interacting with a relief portion of at least one of the two opposed legs of the clevis; and wherein the two opposed legs of the clevis have respective holes formed therein, and wherein the spherical pivot member is pivotably held between the holes formed in the two opposed legs of the clevis; and \n wherein the two opposed legs of the clevis have respective holes formed therein, and wherein the spherical pivot member is pivotably held between the holes formed in the two opposed legs of the clevis. \n \n     \n     \n       12. The razor of  claim 11 , wherein the two opposed legs extend from the cartridge. \n     \n     \n       13. The razor of  claim 11 , wherein the gripping portion includes friction enhancing depressions and protuberances. \n     \n     \n       14. The razor of  claim 11 , wherein a portion of the cartridge limits rotation of the at least one cutting blade."}
