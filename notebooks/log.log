It describes a safety razor comprising a blade unit with at least one cutting edge, a handle casing, and a pivotal connection structure. The pivotal connection structure includes a first member connected to the blade unit, a second member connected to the handle casing, and a joint member with separated joint elements that connect the first and second members. The joint member allows for movement of the first member relative to the second member about a hinge axis that is perpendicular to the cutting edge. The joint member has a thinner wall section towards the hinge axis compared to the joint portions of the first and second members.

DEBUG:llama_index.llm_predictor.base:Claim 1 of patent US8205344B2 states that a safety razor comprises a blade unit with at least one blade having a cutting edge, a handle casing, and a pivotal connection structure. The pivotal connection structure includes a first member connected to the blade unit, a second member connected to the handle casing, and a joint member with separated joint elements that connect the first member and the second member. The joint member facilitates movement of the first member relative to the second member about a hinge axis that is perpendicular to the cutting edge. The joint member has a thinner wall section toward the hinge axis than toward at least one of the joint portions of the first and second members.
